Anish,

I am very happy to read about you. Your aim of becoming a strong problem solver and getting placed in a good company with a high package is a very good goal, and I truly believe you can achieve it with focus and hard work.

Don’t worry that you don’t know programming yet—every expert once started as a beginner. Your interest in CSE and your confidence in asking for help are already your biggest strengths. I will surely guide you in Python and in problem-solving step by step, so that you build a strong foundation.

I also admire the way you shared about your family. With such supportive parents and your own determination, I am confident you will grow into a successful person. 

I really appreciate your positive words about my teaching. I will do my best to share my knowledge with you and help you become not just a programmer, but a confident problem solver. Always stay consistent, believe in yourself, and keep moving forward.

All the very best, Anish—I am sure I will see you achieve your dream.
